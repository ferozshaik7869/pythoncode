What is a Generator function ?

A generator function is a normal function except that it contains yield expression
in the function definition making it a generator function.
Generators are a way of implementing iterators.

This function returns an iterator known as a generator.
To get the next value from a generator, we use next().
"""
# Generator Function :
"""" Execute the below code in python idle/interpreter don't execute in pycharm tool.
For better understanding purpose use python interpreter """


# Generator Function :


# def sunny():
#     print("Ashok")
#     print("Harinath")
#     yield ("Narendra")
#     print("Anand Yadav")
#     print("Surendra")
#     print("devendra")
#     print("veerendra")
#     yield ("End")

# x = sunny()
# >>next(x)
# Ashok
# Harinath
# 'Narendra'
# >> > next(x)
# Anand
# Yadav
# Surendra
# devendra
# veerendra
# 'End'
# >> > next(x)

# Traceback(most
# recent
# call
# last):
# File
# "<pyshell#11>", line
# 1, in < module >
# next(x)
# StopIteration
#
# """
# What happens when we compile the Generators ?
#
# 	1. When we compile the Generators, a Generator Object is created but all its code is not completely run.
# 	2. Execution of the code in a generator stops once a yield statement has been reached.
# 	3. Once yield statement is encountered, it returns a value.
# 	4. When the function is called next time using "next(fun1), the execution continues from the state in which the
# 	generator was left after the last yield.
# This continues until it raises a StopIteration exception.
# """
#
#
#
# """
# What are Generator Expressions ?
#
# Generator Expressions are much like List Comprehensions but
#  the Generator expressions returns an object on which we can iterate using next()
# """
# Example of Generator Expression
#
# >>> gen_exp = (n+1 for n in range(1,4))
# >>> next(gen_exp)
# 2
# >>> next(gen_exp)
# 3
# >>> next(gen_exp)
# 4
# >>> next(gen_exp)
#
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<pyshell#5>", line 1, in <module>
#     next(gen_exp)
# StopIteration
# >>>

# What is an Iterator ?
#
# IteratorÂ is an object which allows a programmer to iterate through all the elements of a collection.
#
# In a normal language,
# we can say, an Iterator is an object which is used to iterate over a group of elements.
#
# """
#
#
# >>> sample = [1,3,5]
# >>> x = iter(sample)
# >>> next(x)
# 1

# 5

# """
# Explanation of the Example :
#
# 	1. Create a list of 3 elements 1,3 and 5.
# 	2. Creating an iterator "it" using iter().
# 	3. The list "sample" is passed to the iter function and the returned object is stored in "it"
# 	4. The first time, next is called, it returns first element "1"
# 	5. The second time, next is called, it returns the second element "3"
# 	6. The third time, next is called, it returns the third element "5"
# 	7. The fourth time, next is called, an error "StopIteration" is returned since there are no more
# Elements to return.
